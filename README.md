#### Video Demo:  https://youtu.be/2hyqBETnh54
#### Description: it is a web app designed to get quote from specialists
##### What this webapp do
It is a web app to gather, compare and confirm quote from specialists. Public can post their project and get quote from specialist. When you have received enough quotes, you can award it to that vendor by clicking confirm button.
##### How to use it
You are required to register to use the web app. The below shows features of the web app
1.	Register
You must register yourself to proceed. The registered username should be unique

2.	Post
Post your project information including title, commencement and completion dates, quantity and etc to allow vendor to quote. I had some restriction in the post such as the dates must be earlier than today’s date, commencement dates must be earlier than completion dates and etc.

3.	Current Project
After you post the project, it will appear here. You can check the status by clicking view button or delete it using delete button. When click view, you can see the details of that vendor

4.	History
The project appears here after you award it.  You can see that vendor info when you click view.

5.	Available project
The available project shows all the project post by users. The vendor can see which project is available now and quote it. The deadline column serves as a guideline when users close the tender. I understand that some users might still want to look for quotes even after deadline. Hence, I don’t hide the projects that is over the deadline. If the project is awarded it will no longer appears here.

6.	Your quote
Your quote shows all the project you have quoted and its status. If the project awarded to you, it would show success, otherwise fail and remain as pending when the project still hasn’t awarded.
##### Motivation
The idea of this app originates when I working as a quantity surveyor where I have to invite quotations from contractors and make a cost comparison in an excel for approval. So I am thinking is this process can be automated without having to input those info manually. That’s why this idea come into my mind.

#### Future Development
In future, I am thinking to expand this web app to carry complicated cost comparison, particularly involving hundreds of items in a project and ask the contractors to input the price into it. Then, generate an excel like cost comparison, showing all the price and amount quoted by contractors. When clicking on “confirm” button, the system will generate a standardized contract to be endorsed by both parties. Besides, I wish to add features that enable two ways communications like chatbox or forum.

#### Struggles and Issues encountered
I am not from computer science background. Hence, I am having difficulties in translating my idea into codes. I had gone through a lot of the video in Youtube, stackoverflow and other platform to look for solutions.
